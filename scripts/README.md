# Solar Potential Analysis Tool

## Overview

This Python script is designed to analyze solar irradiance data and predict the solar potential of different regions based on environmental factors. The tool helps identify regions with the highest potential for solar energy installations by analyzing key metrics such as Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI), and Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI).

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preparation**: Reads and processes CSV files containing solar irradiance and environmental data. that will receive from the notbooks file.
- **Daily Averages Calculation**: Aggregates data to daily averages for key variables, enabling trend analysis.
- **Visualization**: Plots daily average GHI(Global Horizontal Irradiance) trends for each region to visualize solar potential over time.
- **Solar Potential Prediction**: Uses a **linear regression** model to predict GHI(Global Horizontal Irradiance) based on environmental factors like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and barometric pressure.
- **Region Comparison**: Analyzes and compares multiple regions to identify the one with the highest solar potential.

## Code Explanation

### Data Loading and Preparation

The script starts by loading CSV files and converting the `Timestamp` to a datetime format. It then sets this column as the index for time-based analysis:

### Daily Averages Calculation

The `daily_average` function resamples the data to daily frequency, calculating the mean for key variables:

### Visualization

The script plots daily average GHI trends for each region to visualize solar potential:

### Solar Potential Prediction

A linear regression model predicts GHI based on environmental factors:

### Evaluating Regions

The `evaluate_region` function performs the analysis for each region, including calculating daily averages, plotting trends, and predicting GHI:
